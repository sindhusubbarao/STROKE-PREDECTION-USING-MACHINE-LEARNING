# STROKE-PREDECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Stroke is a severe cerebrovascular disease with potentially fatal consequences. Early prediction of stroke risk can significantly aid in preventive measures and timely medical interventions. In this project, we aim to develop a robust machine learning model to predict the likelihood of stroke based on various demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors.
The dataset comprises 5110 patient records with attributes such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease status, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, work type, residency type, and stroke event occurrence. The target variable is whether a patient has experienced a stroke or not.
